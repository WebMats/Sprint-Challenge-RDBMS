Q1: Explain the difference between RDBMS and SQL.
    ANS:
        RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) are tools that let us structure the 
        hierarchy of our database. More precisely: it allows us to make tables and 
        define the type and constrictions of fields within tables. On the other hand, SQL
        is a standardized query language that allows us to interact with our tables.


Q2: Why do tables need a primary key?
    ANS:
        Primary keys are the one piece of information that RDMS's can be sure that will distinctly 
        identify every row in our table.


Q3: What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table.
    ANS:
        Foreign-key


Q4: What do we need in order to have a many to many relationship between two tables.
    ANS:
        We need a 3rd table to keep track of the relationships as well as any other relevant information.
